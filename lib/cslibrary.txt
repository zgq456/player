Nifty.html Stanford Tetris Project This package of material provides a foundation for some fun Java tetris projects. The design uses Piece and Board classes to build the tetris core, and there are Brain classes to add in game playing AI. Readme.txt -- introduction to the tetris materials and how to use them JTetris.jar -- a runnable version of tetris with a built-in rudimentary brain. The brain can play tetris without a human player, or it can drive the "adversary" feature that uses the brain to pick especially bad pieces for the player (hah!). MacJTetris.sit -- JTetris.jar wrapped in a way to run on MacOS 8/9 -- see the readme for instructions Tetris-Architecture.html -- an introduction to the overall design architecture of the tetris classes Instructors-Guide.html -- a discussion of the tetris project for instructors TetrisAssignment.pdf -- the assignment handout we use with our 2nd year CS undergradates to implement tetris TetrisAssignment.rtf -- same as above, but rtf format TetrisStarter.zip -- .java files to get started. The support files are already done (Brain.java, JBoardTest.java, etc.), while the core files like Piece.java and Board.java have the prototypes filled in, but the code is not done. This project was presented as one of the assignments in the Nifty Assignments Panel at SIG-CSE 2001 -- check out that site for more neat assignments.
