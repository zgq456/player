    <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>run</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <tasks>
                    <echo>Hello world!</echo>
                </tasks>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
 One issue though is that you have to choose what phase of the build lifecycle to bind this to (my example has the plugin bound to generate-resources). Unlike Ant, you aren't controlling the lifecycle yourself, but rather just binding plugins to certain points in a pre-defined lifecycle. Depending on what you are actually trying to do, this may or may not make sense for your use case. share|improve this answer answered Aug 5 '10 at 15:56 matt b 77.3k30177248 add a comment |  up vote 1 down vote <plugin>

            <configuration>                                      
                <source>                                         
                    log.info('Test message: {}', 'Hello, World!')
                </source>                                        
            </configuration>                                     
        </execution>                                             
    </executions>                                                
</plugin>                                                        
 The configuration above will produce the following output: [INFO] Test message: Hello, World!
