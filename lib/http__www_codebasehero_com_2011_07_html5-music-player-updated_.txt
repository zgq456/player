I’ll be very grateful if you could help me solve this problem. Hier is the Link to the site: http://lingen-koeln.de/bme/2013-09-26/Helene%20Fischer/demo/index.html Best Regards Paul Paul says: September 11, 2013 at 11:03 am funny thing is that when I go to the demo page with IE, everything works without any problems. But when download the demo folder and check local the index.html under IE7/8, the files can not be played. wenfan says: September 16, 2013 at 6:23 pm Hello, there’s a problem that, why can’t it auto play even if I set autoPlay:true, Thx a lot ! Looking forward to your help! leosin says: September 27, 2013 at 9:13 am me too.. autoPlay:true invalid Saleem says: September 27, 2013 at 5:48 pm Try auoPlay:true and autoplay:true. I vaguely recall the capitalization being wrong, but I don’t remember which is correct. I built this plugin a couple of years ago…. CreativeLatino says: October 3, 2013 at 7:08 pm It is with a lowercase “p”, autoplay Scott says: October 18, 2013 at 7:56 pm Good call with the lower case “p”. I am sure that it is a lot of code for you to go through and change SO NICE keeping up with your comments here. Good Job!!!

However, I am wondering how I can control where it is placed on the page. I am assuming I am missing something within the style.css file. Nevertheless, I a don’t want the player separate from the content on the site. Am I making sense? Ed Emerson says: September 21, 2013 at 4:32 pm Forgive me for I am an idiot. I’ve gotten the player working fine on my page but am at a loss to understand how to position it properly. It’s appearing at the bottom of my page, below the footer. I’m not very familiar with javascript. How can I tell it where to appear on the page? Do I need to add something after $(‘body’). http://vudoucircuit.com/emtw fishy says: October 13, 2013 at 2:26 pm you can change the $(‘body’) to: $(‘.someclassname’) in the html add wherever you want it possitioned RMK says: September 29, 2013 at 7:45 am Hey great work …!! Easy to use and just everything i need … But one question … how can i link on the player to play as example the 3rd track of the playlist? How can i start another track then the first one if i want to make a direct link from another location/website? Thanx for your great work! RaZz! says: October 2, 2013 at 1:17 pm I Love this! Thank you. How could I use currentTime? For example I want to put a Mixtape with 20 tracks in one MP3 in the player. How can I jump to the tracks? Best regards, RaZz! mehrdad says: October 13, 2013 at 6:13 am How to Enable Volume Control? Oliver says: October 13, 2013 at 12:35 pm Hi, how can I choose where to place it? Regards Anton says: October 14, 2013 at 9:23 pm Hello, very good player. Is there a simple way to programatically switch to another track? For examle $(‘.jp-next’).click() don’t work for me. Saleem says: October 15, 2013 at 10:31 pm I’ve never tried, but $(‘.jp-next’).trigger(‘click’) might work. Trevor says: October 17, 2013 at 12:30 am Hi, I love the player. Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to work in Firefox. When viewed in Firefox 24.0 on my mac the controls do not work and no audio will play. Has anyone else seen this or had any luck getting it to work? Works great in Safari (desktop and mobile) and Chrome. Thanks! chepalana says: October 17, 2013 at 5:44 am Hello, I am trying to add number of times music is being played. I would like to call it everytime the song changes to it’s next track. But, I can’t find what event is used to play the next song. Can you please help me, any ideas? Thanks SenorCoolGuy says: October 20, 2013 at 4:36 am Looks good, but needs a random feature.
