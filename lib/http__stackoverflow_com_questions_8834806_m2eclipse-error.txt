When I enable maven dependecy management, eclipse mark some errors in the pom file, this error is:  Multiple annotations found at this line:

 Any idea?

Does "mvn clean package" work on the console? –  KarlsFriend Jan 12 '12 at 12:33      no don't work, same error –  McSas Jan 12 '12 at 12:40 1   my coworkers that use Windows are with same problem. I'm using ubuntu, same version of maven and eclipse, same project... and everything works fine... –  caarlos0 Apr 24 '12 at 18:04 add a comment |  14 Answers 14 active oldest votes up vote 44 down vote I had same problem with Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo) and maven 3.0.4. In my case, the problem was caused by missing maven-resources-plugin-2.4.3.jar in {user.home}\.m2\repository\org\apache\maven\plugins\maven-resources-plugin\2.4.3 folder. (no idea why maven didn't update it) Solution: 1.) add dependency to pom.xml <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.4.3</version>
</dependency>
 2.) run mvn install from Eclipse or from command line 3.) refresh the project in eclipse (F5) 4.) run Maven > Update Project Configuration... on project (right click) JAR file is downloaded to local repository and there are no errors in WS. share|improve this answer edited Apr 25 '12 at 6:32 answered Mar 8 '12 at 12:52 Betlista 3,37422050      didn't work here... –  caarlos0 Apr 24 '12 at 18:04      did you checked that there is org\apache\maven\plugins\maven-resources-plugin\2.4.3 in repository ? –  Betlista Apr 24 '12 at 19:32      yep, 2.3, 2.4.3 and 2.5. Actually, after a lot of refreshes, mvn install eclipse:eclipse, cleans, close and reopen eclipse, it finally seem to work... but, it become with another error: "Unknow error". any idea? –  caarlos0 Apr 24 '12 at 20:14      Try to look into {eclipse.workspace}\.metadata\.log. –  Betlista Apr 25 '12 at 6:30 add a comment |  up vote 21 down vote I also had same problem with Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo) and maven 3.0.4. Eclipse wasn't picking up my maven settings, so this is what I did to fix the problem: Window - Preferences - Maven - Installations Add (Maven 3.0.4 instead of using Embedded) Click Apply & OK Maven > Update Project Configuration... on project (right click) Shutdown Eclipse Run mvn install from the command line. Open Eclipse Those steps worked for me, but the problem isn't consistent. I've only had with issue on one computer. share|improve this answer edited Jun 23 '13 at 15:27 sri 174 answered Aug 31 '12 at 16:22 Kyght 47647 add a comment |  up vote 8 down vote Just go to your user folder, inside it there's a ".m2" folder, open it and delete the folder "repository". Go to eclipse, clean your project, then right click->Maven->Update Project .. and you are ready to go. share|improve this answer answered Jun 29 '12 at 21:51 Kalaji 33626      That solve my issue!

Then I restarted eclipse and did a clean/build on the project and All Was Well. –  Laura Apr 23 '13 at 12:44 add a comment |  up vote 6 down vote accepted In this particular case, the solution was the right proxy configuration of eclipse (Window -> Preferences -> Network Connection), the company possessed a strict security system. I will leave the question, because there are answers that can help the community. Thank you very much for the answers above. share|improve this answer answered Jul 4 '12 at 12:12 McSas 85411230 add a comment |  up vote 3 down vote In my case the problem was solved by Window -> Preferences -> Maven -> User Settings -> Update Settings. I don't know the problem cause at the first place. share|improve this answer answered Aug 13 '13 at 16:56 mohamed haseeb 464 add a comment |  up vote 1 down vote I would add some points that helped me to solve this problem : When all other missing archetypes have been indeed installed into your local repository, and the only remaining and abnormally sticking error is this (damned ..) one, whereas the maven-filtering-x.jar is present in his directory, the problem could finally only be solved by creating a new work space as was suggested by Dan in his response ( http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-isis-dev/201112.mbox/%3CCALJOYLFfSJ5Xc_z7a7N+S2_kabuVv0ykv7A5afQaJJOb99iCdg@mail.gmail.com%3E ) (thanks). Having the local repository OK, on the other hand, turned out to be quite costly, as many archetypes would not get loaded, due apparently to timeouts of m2eclipse and very unstable communication speeds in my case. In many cases only the error file could be found in the folder ex : xxx.jar.lastUpdated, instead of the jar or pom file. I had always to suppress this file to permit a new download. Also really worthy were : as already said, using the mvn clean install from the command line, apparently much more patient than m2eclipse, and also efficient and verbose, at least for the time being. (and also the Update Project of the Maven menu) downloading using the dependency:get goal mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.1:get -DrepoUrl=url -Dartifact=groupId:artifactId:version1 (from within the project folder) (hint given in another thread, thanks also). also downloading and installing manually (.jar+.sha1), from in particular, "m2proxy atlassian" . adding other repositories in the pom.xml itself (the settings.xml mirror configuration did'nt do the job, I don't know yet why). Ex : nexus/content/repositories/releases/ et nexus/content/repositories/releases/, sous repository.jboss.org, ou download.java.net/maven/2 . To finish, in any case, a lot of time (!..) could have been et could certainly still be spared with a light tool repairing thoroughly the local repository straightaway. I could not yet find it. Actually it should even be normally a mvn command ("--repair-local-repository"). share|improve this answer edited Mar 10 '13 at 17:14 Krishnachandra Sharma 828830 answered Mar 10 '13 at 16:49 Laurent Chrétien 111 add a comment |  up vote 1 down vote This what helped me: Delete the project from eclipse (but don't delete from disk) Close eclipse In your user folder there is .m folder. Delete repository folder underneath it (.m/repository). Open eclipse Import project as existing maven project (from disk). Good luck. share|improve this answer edited Feb 10 '14 at 14:35 eebbesen 1,96021030 answered Feb 10 '14 at 14:17 KerenSi 154 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote It must be a configuration problem. Your pom is fine. Here's what I did. New folder, put your pom inside. Then in eclipse: import -> maven -> existing maven project. Dependencies got included in the project. I did this using eclipse helios. I think the plugin version I am using is 0.12 You should check the maven properties in eclipse. share|improve this answer edited Nov 9 '12 at 22:31 Ryan 16712 answered Jan 12 '12 at 12:26 KarlsFriend 306213      where are the maven properties in eclipse? –  McSas Jan 12 '12 at 12:32      I tried to put the pom file in a new folder. When I try to import the project eclipse show two erros: * No marketplace entries found to handle maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:testCompile in Eclipse. and * No marketplace entries found to handle maven-compiler-plugin:2.3.2:compile in Eclipse. // any idea? –  McSas Jan 12 '12 at 12:38 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote This error bothered me for two days. I tried all kinds of solutions, nothing worked. Finally I give up and tried a radical approach. and it worked! Here are the steps: Save a copy of the pom.xml, deleted all text in pom.xml Let eclipse do a clean rebuild, of course everything will be broken. pasted back everything in the original pom.xml let Eclipse build again I guess it was "indeterministic" as the following article said. http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_covered share|improve this answer answered Mar 26 '13 at 20:00 hli 1112 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote in my case there was a dependency without a version. in eclipse m2e does not force you to enter a version so i left it blank. once i put the version in pom.xml from within eclipse all was fine share|improve this answer answered Apr 22 '13 at 23:40 necromancer 4,65052763 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote I had a similar case for the default groovy compiler plugin The solution was to install ME2 provided by Springsource according to this answer Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration maven error This immediately solved the "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" problem in Eclispe Juno. share|improve this answer answered May 4 '13 at 16:48 simou 6212822 add a comment |  up vote 0 down vote I had the same problem but with an other cause.

What I originally tried was to install Maven via the terminal using Brew. It installed correctly Maven 3.0.4. However when I tried to import any ready maven projects (File > Import > Maven) it would display the following two errors: No marketplace entries found to handle Execution default-testResources What I did is go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace and type "Maven" in the search bar and install the first default Maven client for Eclipse. Everything worked for me from this point.
