  ...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>ftp-repository</id>
      <url>ftp://repository.mycompany.com/repository</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>

  <build>
    <extensions>
      <!-- Enabling the use of FTP -->
      <extension>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
         <artifactId>wagon-ftp</artifactId>
         <version>1.0-beta-6</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
  </build>
  ...
</project> Your settings.xml would contain a server element where the id of that element matches id of the FTP repository specified in the POM above: <settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ftp-repository</id>
      <username>user</username>
      <password>pass</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  ...
</settings> You should, of course, make sure that you can login into the specified FTP server by hand before attempting the deployment with Maven. Once you have verified that everything is setup correctly you can now deploy your artifacts using Maven: mvn deploy © 2004-2014 The Apache Software Foundation - Privacy Policy.
