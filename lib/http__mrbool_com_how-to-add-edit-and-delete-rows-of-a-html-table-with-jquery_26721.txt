Would you like to comment what you didn't like? Yes, I confirm my negative vote Let's assume the existence of a simple HTML table, that lists a cadastration of clients with three columns: Name, Telephone and E-mail. We wish to add functionalities to do addition, edition and exclusion of lines of this table.To do so, we'll use JavaScript, more specifically, we'll make use of the library jQuery to manipulate the events and functions that will be created. It is worthy to remember that the focus of this article is not the way this data will be stored, we shall treat only the information in the HTML table. As a suggestion, there's another article, in which it's explained how to store data in the HTML 5 Local Storage. So, let's start working. To begin with, we'll add one more column to the table, in which there'll be the buttons of action (Save, Edit, Delete) and a button outside the table. This one will be responsible to start the addition of a new register. Lets observe the HTML structure: Listing 1: HTML structure 
<html>
<head>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="functions.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<button id="btnAddd”>New</button>
	<table id="tblData">			
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Phone</th>
				<th>Email</th>
				<th></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</body>
</html>
 The structure is fearsome simple, basically a button and a table. It have been added two links to two JavaScript files: the first one is the jQuery library itself (that may be found online, but in this case it was used a file obtained in the official webpage). The second one is a file that we'll create, in which will be the functions that'll give functionalities to the elements of the "clients cadastration". Now, we'll create four functions: Add, Delete, Edit and Save. Let us see below each one's code: Listing 2: Add function 
function Add(){
	$("#tblData tbody").append(
		"<tr>"+
		"<td><input type='text'/></td>"+
		"<td><input type='text'/></td>"+
		"<td><input type='text'/></td>"+
		"<td><img src='images/disk.png' class='btnSave'><img src='images/delete.png' class='btnDelete'/></td>"+
		"</tr>");
	
		$(".btnSave").bind("click", Save);		
		$(".btnDelete").bind("click", Delete);
}; 
 The Add function creates a new row in the table, in which each one of the first columns contains a field of text to the entrance of data and the last column contains two images that'll work as buttons of action Save and Delete/Cancel. After adding the row with the fields for entrance of data, we'll link the event onClick of the buttons of action to two different functions that are written short below. Listing 3: Save function 
function Save(){
	var par = $(this).parent().parent(); //tr
	var tdName = par.children("td:nth-child(1)");
	var tdPhone = par.children("td:nth-child(2)");
	var tdEmail = par.children("td:nth-child(3)");
	var tdButtons = par.children("td:nth-child(4)");

	tdName.html(tdName.children("input[type=text]").val());
	tdPhone.html(tdPhone.children("input[type=text]").val());
	tdEmail.html(tdEmail.children("input[type=text]").val());
	tdButtons.html("<img src='images/delete.png' class='btnDelete'/><img src='images/pencil.png' class='btnEdit'/>");

	$(".btnEdit").bind("click", Edit);
	$(".btnDelete").bind("click", Delete);
}; 
 Initially, this function localizes the parent element of the element that contains the button Save, in other words, the TR element the contain the TD in which is the IMG. Knowing the line of the table that is on editing, we localize individually each one of the cells, finding them by their index with which they appear on the line. It all have been done, we shall update the content of each cell, passing to them the value of the field of text contained on them. With that, we finalize the register insertion. At the end, we'll update the functions of the button Edit and Delete. This is required because new elements are not referenced, so it is necessary to "force" the reference. Listing 4: Edit function 
function Edit(){
	var par = $(this).parent().parent(); //tr
	var tdName = par.children("td:nth-child(1)");
	var tdPhone = par.children("td:nth-child(2)");
	var tdEmail = par.children("td:nth-child(3)");
	var tdButtons = par.children("td:nth-child(4)");

	tdName.html("<input type='text' id='txtName' value='"+tdName.html()+"'/>");
	tdPhone.html("<input type='text' id='txtPhone' value='"+tdPhone.html()+"'/>");
	tdEmail.html("<input type='text' id='txtEmail' value='"+tdEmail.html()+"'/>");
	tdButtons.html("<img src='images/disk.png' class='btnSave'/>");

	$(".btnSave").bind("click", Save);
	$(".btnEdit").bind("click", Edit);
	$(".btnDelete").bind("click", Delete);
};
 The Edit function works in a similar way, in certain parts, as the other two. Initially it is localized each cell individually of the line that contains the button that activated the function. Having control upon these elements, we'll add to each cell a field of text (<input type=’text’>) which initial content (value property) is the text that is in the cell. Lastly, once more we update the functions of the buttons. Listing 5: Delete function 
function Delete(){
	var par = $(this).parent().parent(); //tr
	par.remove();
}; 
 That is, visually, the most simple function of our code. It's functioning resumes to identify the TR element that contains the button that activated the function and remove it from it's parent element, in other words, the TBODY of the table. Now that we already know the functions to be used, lasts only to initialize the buttons events, linking them to the defined functionalities. All of this code is put into the main function that's executed in the moment that the site is loaded. According to the jQuery syntax, our file funções.js should have the following structure: Listing 6: File functions.js 
$(function(){
	//Add, Save, Edit and Delete functions code
	$(".btnEdit").bind("click", Edit);
	$(".btnDelete").bind("click", Delete);
	$("#btnAdd").bind("click", Add);
});

I have used copy/paste to create the two files with your code but nothing happens when I click on the 'new' button. (by the way: the id 'btnAddd' in the HTML structure has one 'd' to many; also the double closing quotation mark directly behind this id label is not a correct straight double quotation mark).

[+1 year ago]   Answer it   Theo Tutsme Thanks Joel, saw that the source files were added later today. They work like a charm!! [+1 year ago]   Answer it   Theo Tutsme Hi Joel, why does the edit function also bind a click event to the Delete button and the same for Edit? I only see a Save button added in the function. And why does listing 6 not contain an invocation of the Save function? I am relatively new to jQuery so I'd appreciate it if you could explain these 2 issues more fully. [+1 year ago]    Answer it   [author] Joel Rodrigues Hi, Theo. Here is the answers: 1) You can remove the lines 14 and 15 of the listing 4 (these bindings is not necessary). As you said, we just need to bind the click event of the save button that is created. Thank you for the advice. 2) We don't need to use the Save function at the listing 6 because when the page loads, there is no save button visible. The save button only appears when we click the add or edit buttons. However, if the table contains lines, there will be edit and delete buttons visible. Best regards.

[+1 month ago]    Answer it   [author] Joel Rodrigues Hi, Tejas. How are you? To insert dropdowns, you can do the same way we have done to insert inputs, just changing the tag <input> to <select> and adding the options. To save the data, you can send it via Ajax to a server page (like PHP, ASP.NET, Java, etc) using jQuery. Thank you for your comment.

I would like to replace the email text field with a file input, and have the saved table entry be a link to the selected file. I got as far as changing the input type to "file" to put a choose file button in that cell but am not sure how to get the FileReader object in the context of your code. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!! [+1 month ago]    Answer it   [author] Joel Rodrigues Hi, Gary. Thank you for your comment. To upload a file you will need a back-end language, right? Maybe you can submit the data using jQuery and receive a answer with the link to the uploaded file. [+1 month ago]   Answer it   ryan wla The table doesn't save the data I input, even if I click save. When I refresh the page, it's gone and back to the default info. How can I fix this?

Hut I will try to write a new article to Talk about it. Maybe I will use ASP.net MVC or PHP. Thank you for reading. [+1 month ago]   Answer it   Kavan This is great code Joel! Thank you so much. In my code I was trying to make an alteration by adding a cancel button next to the disk save icon in the editing mode - just in case the user decides to discard all the changes made. Could you guide me to a possible solution to making this work [+1 month ago]    Answer it   [author] Joel Rodrigues Hi, Kavan. Thank you for the comment. When the user clicks on the edit button, you can store the original field values into variables and if the user clicks on cancel button, you put these original values on the inputs again. Try it and let me know if you made it.

[+1 year ago]    Answer it   [author] Joel Rodrigues Hi, Nixy. You can read all columns of the current row, create an array and use it as you need.
