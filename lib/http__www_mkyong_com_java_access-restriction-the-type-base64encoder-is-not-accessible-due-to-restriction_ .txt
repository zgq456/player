on required library 
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/classes.jar P.S Using JDK 1.6 and Eclipse IDE 4.2 import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder; // Access restriction error 
 
   //...
   result = new BASE64Encoder().encode(rawHmac); Solution Using sun.* package should be avoided, read this statement. If you insist want to use sun.misc.BASE64Encoder, in Eclipse, right click on the project, properties -> Java compiler –> Errors/Warnings –> Deprecated and restricted API –> Forbidden reference (access rules), change the default “Error” to “Warning“. Now, your code should be able to compile, but with some warning messages. The above solution is not recommended, you should replace sun.misc.BASE64Encoder with other BASE64 class like Apache common codec. import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
 
    //...	
    result = new Base64().encodeToString(rawHmac); References Alexa Web Information Service Apache common codec Why Developers Should Not Write Programs That Call ‘sun’ Packages Tags : alexa eclipse seo mkyong Founder of Mkyong.com and HostingCompass.com, love Java and open source stuff.

Who would have thought it was as easy as changing from “Error” to “Warning”.

I like to write a little comment to support you. http://mudassirshahzad.com Mudassir Shahzad You are the man! BASE64Encoder is a great tool :) Thanks for sharing Frisian Base64 encoding and decoding is part of the JDK since Java 6: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter.html No need to use the sun classes anymore. http://mudassirshahzad.com Mudassir Shahzad Frisian, The only problem that I have with java jdk’s base64 encoding api is that it is licensed.
